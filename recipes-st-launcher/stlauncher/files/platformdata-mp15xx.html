	<h2>STM32MP15xx Microprocessors</h2>
	<p class="ow-break-word">The <b>STM32MP15xx</b> microprocessors are based on the ARM&#174; <b>Cortex&#174;-A7</b> dual core. 
They support <b>Trustzone</b> mode for secure operations, a <b>Vivante GPU</b> and an ARM&#174; <b>Cortex&#174;-M4</b> coprocessor.</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">These microprocessors are targeting industry 4.0, factory automation, smart metering, smart homes 
and electric vehicle charging infrastructure applications.</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">They are based on the flexible architecture of a Dual ARM&#174; <b>Cortex&#174;-A7</b> core running 
up to <b>800 MHz</b> and <b>Cortex&#174;-M4</b> at <b>209 MHz</b> combined with a dedicated <b>3D</b> graphics processing unit 
(GPU) and <b>MIPI-DSI</b> display interface.</p>

	<h2 style="color: deeppink";>STM32MP157F Discovery Kit</h2>
	<p class="ow-break-word">The <b>STM32MP157F-DK2</b> Discovery kit is designed as complete demonstration and development platforms 
for <b><i>STMicroelectronics</i></b> ARM&#174;-based dual <b>Cortex&#174;-A7</b> 32 bits and <b>Cortex&#174;-M4</b> 32 bits MPUs in 
the STM32MP1 Series and their STPMIC1 companion chip.</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">They leverage the capabilities increased-frequency 800 MHz of STM32MP1 Series microprocessors to allow 
users to develop applications using STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution software (such as STM32MP1Starter) for the main processor and 
STM32CubeMP1 software for the co-processor.</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">They feature 16-bit DDR3L 4 Gbits at 533 MHz, MIPI DSI&#174; 2 lanes at 1 Gbps, USB Type-C&#174; DRP HS 
port, USB Type-A Host HS ports, audio codec with analog audio input / output, microSD&#8482; card high-speed mode up to 50 MHz, Gigabit 
Ethernet, HDMI&#174; up to 720p60 (1280 &#215; 720), 40-pin extended GPIOs, ARDUINO&#174;, Wi&#45;Fi&#174; 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth&#174; 
Low Energy 4.1, and ST-LINK/V2-1 (UART console).</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">The STM32MP157F-DK2, shown with display removed in Figure 1 and Figure 2, is used as a reference design 
for user application development. It cannot be considered as the hardware design of a final application. The hardware features of the 
Discovery kits are available for users to develop their applications: USB, Ethernet, LTDC, TFT LCD MIPI DSI&#174;, microSD&#8482; card, 
audio codec, user buttons, Wi&#45;Fi&#174;, and Bluetooth&#174; Low Energy. Extension headers allow easy connection of an ARDUINO&#174; 
board for a specific application.</p><p></p>
	<p class="ow-break-word">An ST-LINK/V2-1 is integrated on the board, as embedded in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM32 
MPU and the USB Virtual COM port bridge.<p>
